We recommend using UPX to compress the build file (agent.exe), so we have left the UPX binary in this directory.

Usage (in the command-line): `upx agent.exe` (without the `)

If you don't trust the binary source, you can download it directly from the UPX GitHub page:
https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/latest
